# Welcome to Skycade Report!

Created by Atticus Zambrana (MrBeefSteak) for the Skycade Network


## What is this plugin?

This plugin gives the players of Skycade a super easy and fast way to report ANYTHING to the staff team! With a simple command, you can report any kind of rule breaker.

## What permissions do my players and staff need?

Give all players the permission node 'skycadereport.report'

Then give all staff members (That you would like to recieve the alerts) the permission node 'skycadereport.staff'

Your Admins and System Admins will also get the permission node 'skycadereport.admin' to shut off the report system

## What commands are included with this plugin?

There is are only three commands!

/report, which you follow by the name of the player you would like to report, and then the reason for reporting the player.

Example: /report JackSucksAtMC Selling out
Another example: /report MrBeefSteak being the best developer ever

Then /togglereports, if a staff member want to do something, without being spammed by player reports.

and Finally /togglereportsystem, Which requires the permission node 'skycadereport.admin'

This will disable the ability for ANYONE to report any players. good for if players are sending false reports.
